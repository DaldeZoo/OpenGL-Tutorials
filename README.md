# OpenGL-Tutorials
These are a collection of OpenGL tutorials I made while learning how to build a 3D Raycaster engine. Each tutorial is a C program with detailed comments that thoroughly explain how OpenGL renders graphics onto the screen. Initially, I made these tutorials for my own learning, but I noticed they could actually be a very helpful resource to others.

These tutorials touch on a wide range of topics and will give you a deep understanding of how OpenGL works.
