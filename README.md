# OpenGL-Tutorials
These are a collection of OpenGL tutorials I made while learning how to build a 3D Raycaster engine. Each tutorial is a C program with detailed comments that thoroughly explain how OpenGL renders graphics onto the screen. Initially, I made these tutorials for my own learning, but I noticed they could actually be a very helpful resource to others. These tutorials touch on a wide range of topics and will give you a deep understanding of how OpenGL works.

Please checkout my [Raycaster](https://github.com/DaldeZoo/3D-Raycaster-Engine) for details on how you can run these programs with MinGW or [download Dev-C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/) and follow [this tutorial](https://www.evl.uic.edu/aspale/dvl/dev-cpp/).
